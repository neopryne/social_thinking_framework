How to Read This Document

I recommend installing Obsidian or similar software for viewing this.
If you are using Obsidian, run it, and open the folder this readme is in as a vault.
You should then see five nested levels each with their own items.
This document uses nested vaults. Each level is its own vault so that you can look at lower levels without the clutter of the rest.
There are downsides to nested vaults, like name collision and file overwriting, but this can be mitigated with version control software.

This document uses git as its version control software to track changes and the evolving history of the document.
How we got somewhere is important information, and I posit that any document worth having should document its entire history, given
that this is comparatively cheap now.

On top of this, we can take advantage of github for distribution.  ⁂Lim's version is online at https://github.com/neopryne/social_thinking_framework.  See [[How to Read This Document]] for more info.
