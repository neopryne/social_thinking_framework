Understanding how to write good code is a process.  At first, you may write the same method three times before you see the ways it can be made clearer by breaking it into smaller methods with more reuse.  As you get better, you will see how it can be made cleaner after only writing a single method.  Mastery of this property is when you can see how it can be made cleaner before you write anything.
