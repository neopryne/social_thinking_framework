Never claim to be the ultimate authority on anything.

No document may claim itself to be the only truth, for claiming that you know you are correct is a lie.  [[Mind]]s can never be certain of anything, only very sure.

[[Truth, Absolute]] exists, but you can never know for certain [what they are|that you have found one].

Our perception of the world changes, and so must the texts that inform our actions.  Thus any religion worth its salt must accept its own imperfection and need of change in order to continue to be good and useful to the people it claims to serve.

This page has such a pompous title because if you lose this, you've lost the plot.
