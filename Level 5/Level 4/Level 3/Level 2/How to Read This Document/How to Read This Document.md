You may encounter things that are not proper grammar, or even proper words.  These may be errors, or may be things designed to get you to imagine what they might be, or things that try to describe something there are not words for.  There is a very valid version of this document somewhere that is mostly gibberish.  Perhaps you [are creating|will create] it.

### Using Git
This vault is part of a git repo in order to keep track of how it changes over time.  You can find tutorials for how to use git on youtube.

To update your local files to the latest version, first commit your changes, then run
```
git pull --rebase
```
You may need to resolve conflicts if you changed parts of a file that were also changed in the github repo.

### Obsidian
You can read these files with any old text editor, but it's designed to be read with Obsidian, or similar application.  To open this in Obsidian, install it from https://obsidian.md/, run Obsidian.exe and select the FRAME-WORK folder to open as a vault.
