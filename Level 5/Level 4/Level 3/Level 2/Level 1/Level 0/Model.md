A model is an imperfect representation of a thing.  All observations of reality [are built on|are actually|use] models that your [[mind]] is internally constructing and running to sensemake of all the data your senses give you.  All models are [incomplete](Incompleteness).  What makes a model good is how useful it is in thinking about the thing it models.  Common kinds of thinking are predicting, relational, and [belief](Confidence) networks.

Sufficiently interesting models cannot contain themselves, because they expand into infinity.  Actually this might be false, I'm not an expert on containing infinities.

At any rate, I don't know how to make such a model here and now.
