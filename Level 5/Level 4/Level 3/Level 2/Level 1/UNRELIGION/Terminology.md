There are participants, not members.  To be a member of something is to subscribe to a larger system.  The system of UNRELIGION is only as valid as the members that it arises out of.  I'm unclear on what it means for a participant to become a member, but I think it implies a coalescing of belief into a (more) singular form.  Hm.  Maybe factions and subfactions can organize themselves.  I should find a cool name for these factions.  Actually, I have a couple action attractors I could insert here.  Hell Destroyers, Rescue Corps, and Burning Avatars of Humanity.

A collection of individuals that come together to discuss UNRELIGION and do things due to urges and inspirations that arise [out of|from] it are a cohesion*.
