First, definitions out of the way.  I do not speak of a given religion's definition of God.
I speak of the thing that is outside of, and conceptually above, all other things.  That which is outside and \[[unknowable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sof)|incomprehensible].  As a [[Timeless]] thing, God cannot interact with reality.  The timeless God cannot act, for it does not change, and does not interact.  The timeless God exists outside of timefull reality, passively shaping it by virtue of being self-consistent.  It cannot think, for thinking involves change.  It merely is.

Instead, what we see that looks like God is, in fact, lots of [[GOD]]s walking around trying to imitate God.

Some people claim that God is perfect.  I think this is unlikely to be true in any way that we can agree on.  God might be perfect in God's view, but as our view is never God's view, God will never be perfect in our eyes.
