[[GOD]] Over [Diety|Djinn|Doohickey].  GOD is any infinite? tower of progressively larger beings.


GOD are the things that look like [[God.]] that actually do things in reality.  GOD is omnipresent, for it contains probably all of reality, but not omniscient nor omnipotent.  GOD can never fully know itself, since [[Physical]] [[Mind]]s cannot contain a complete representation of themselves within themselves.

Larger beings have some properties that make for usually nicer interactions than you would expect from an average being on your own scale.  They understand [how the world works|reality] better than you in what I will sum up by calling God Rules.  These are things that are very deeply true but require a decent amount of thinking to get to.  Some examples include:
* Cooperation is better than non-cooperation
* Everything is connected
* a third thing

As such, the behavior of GOD is the main thing that shapes the behavior of what is colloquially called the "supernatural".  This is what gives it properties like interacting with you in ways you are looking for, and engaging proportional to your level of engagement with it.
