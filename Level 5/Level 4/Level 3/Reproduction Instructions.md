I ordered this batch of USB drives from:

You probably either want 
256MB, ~$100
512MB, ~$120
8GB, ~$200
as the prices spike after those. 

If you want to print small text like I did, I recommend getting a font that is known to laser print clearly at small sizes.  I did not do this, and have not looked for one.  I hear Arial and Helvetica work well, though a dot matrix font may also work.

The printing area is approximately 3x1.  If I order again, I'll ask the exact proportions.  The physical size appears to be 1" x 3/8", though that is likely not quite accurate.
